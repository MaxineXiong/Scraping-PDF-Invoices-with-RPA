This repository houses an automation solution that harnesses the power of **[UiPath Automation Platform](https://www.uipath.com/)** to effortlessly **scrape data**, including *Company Name, Invoice Number, Date, Customer ID, Payment Terms*, and *Total Amount*, from a substantial batch of **1000 invoices issued to different customers**. The extracted data is then intelligently compiled and stored in the **invoices_data.xlsx** Excel file, offering a streamlined alternative to the laborious and time-consuming task of manually collecting and entering data from these invoices. Remarkably, this RPA robot completes the process in just **around 130 minutes**, achieving nearly **100% accuracy**, a feat that would otherwise consume days of human effort.
